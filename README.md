# MeSHHeading2vec
MeSHHeading2vec: A new method for representing MeSH headings as feature vectors based on graph embedding algorithm

There are 5 csv files including 3 MeSH related files and 2 benchmark datasets.
1, MeSHAndEntry is a Correspondence Table to convert the entry terms to standard MeSH headings.
2, MeSHheading LabelList is a label file as described in the manuscript.
3, MeSHheading relationship network is the network we constructed from tree structure.
4, Drug-target interaction and MiRNA-disease association are 2 benchmark datasets.

An open source toolkit called OpenNE was performed to carry out the network embedding tasks.
